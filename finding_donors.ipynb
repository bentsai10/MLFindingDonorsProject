    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will employ several supervised algorithms of my choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Then,  I will choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. My goal is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, we need to clean, format, and restructure the data. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Running the code cell below will plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the code cell below will normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000$ and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\" and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "    - Model Strengths <br />\n",
    "    SVM works well in situations of high dimensions and is quite good and avoiding overfitting tendencies. SVM works well in situations of high dimensions due to the kernel trick of elevating data points into a higher dimension, finding the \"best-fit\" separator in that dimension, and converting that separator back into the terms of the previous dimension. SVM also possesses a certain versatility given that kernels can be adjusted to provide more possibilities to divide data. \n",

    "Dear CharityML, <br />\n",
    "The Adaboost model is the best model out of the three options I provided. In the training set, the decision tree model has the better f-score by a sizable margin throughout the progression in the training set. However, due to not setting the hyperparameter of max depth on the decision tree, we know decision trees have a tendency to overfit, so it is no surprise its f-score on the training set is much higher. However, the true measure of the best model comes with the testing set. As you can see from the bar chart above, with each progressively larger percentage of the training set used, adaboost is the model with the highest f-score. We also see the prediction and training time of the adaboost model is significantly less than the svm model. Given its advantages over the other two models in addition to its strength in predictions nonlinear results, adaboost proves to be the best choice to help us to locate donors for our surely honorable cause.<br />\n",

    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "P.S. The adaboost model is a type of ensemble method. The two chief competing variables in finding a good machine learning model are the model's bias and its variance. Ensemble methods use other models to create imperfect models labeled as \"weak learners.\" A number of these weak learners are created and combined to become an ensemble of weak models, or a single \"strong learner.\" By combining different models, ensemble methods hope to mediate one model's tendency for high bias and low variance (linear regression for example) with another's tendency for low bias and high variance (decision trees). <br />\n",
    "Adaboost itself uses a weighting system to assign weights to each datapoint. Instead of creating other models, it combines iterations of weighting on one model. In simpler terms, every data point in the adaboost model starts with an equal weight, but misclassified points are assigned greater weights. Weights are similar to a grading system, if the model misclassifies a point of higher weight, it will have higher error, so the higher weight discourages the model from continuously misclassifying the same point, which will improve the model with each iteration. In addition, in our case, data points with income >50K will have positive weight and those with lower income will have negative weight.  With each \"line\" or division created from each iteration, regions classified by >50K and <=50K will be created. To determine which is which, adaboost simply sums up the weight of each region. If the sum is positive, data points landing in that particular region are likely to have income of >50K and vice versa. "

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",

    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

    "As you can see, the optimized model improved both the accuracy score and the f-score quite significantly, with accuracy improving by ~.005 and f-score improving by ~0.01. This clearly establishes the optimized model as the superior model. The naive predictor had a accuracy score of 0.2478 and an f-score of 0.2365. Again, our optimized model has four times the accuracy and three times the f-score. This is to be expected as our naive predictor simply predicted everyone to have more than 50K income. "

    "The five features are similar to what I predicted in question 6, with only hours-per-week being the only variable I did not predict to be important. The graph confirms my belief in the importance of capital_gain, capital_loss, and education_num. However, while I believed age to be important, I vastly undersold its importance. In addition, while I missed hours-per-week's importance, it's logical to understand how that affects income, especially given some jobs' tendency to compensate on a per hour basis. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model I found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

Certainly, if training time was a factor and our dataset was of a significantly large size, I would consider using just the reduced data, given the fact that these variables contribute to nearly half the weight of all the variables. However, the ideal solution is still to use all variables given the significant drop off in f-score"
